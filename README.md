# Notice
This is my first attempt to add to gitrepo.  Whatever you see here is NOT perfect or even close, I found something I wanted to add to HACS and am attempting to do it so bear with me.



## Why?
I have been doing IT for a few years and home projects are one of the few things that I actually find joy in.  I want to give back in some way that may be meaningful.  I want to enable others to have a seamless and cost friendly alternative to skylight calendars because their costs are insane.


## What?
With this, you can use the scheduling system from donetick.com to create the schedule for the family.  How you set up the users is up to you but this is going to be designed to, essentially, allow you to see in HACS what you would see on the donetick webUI and update them both in real time.  


## How?
I don't know yet, I'm working on it.


## Next steps
Figuring it out as I go....  Please be patient.
